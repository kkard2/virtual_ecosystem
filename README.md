# Virtual ecosystem

App for simulating a simple environment.

# Prerequisites

CMake version 3.12 (or higher) and a C++ build system (MSVC, GCC, MinGW, Ninja, etc.)
which supports C++20. CMake should be configured to use this build system.

# Building

Create a directory `build`, navigate to it, and execute `cmake ..`.
This should create the project files for the default build system
specified in CMake settings.

Then you can run `cmake --build .` to build the project.
